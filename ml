Recall or sensitivity:

sensitivity, recall, hit rate, or true positive rate (TPR) = TP/TP+FN

Precision:

Precision or positive predictive value (PPV) = TP/TP+ FP

Specificity:

specificity or true negative rate (TNR) = TN /TN + FP

Accuracy (ACC):

ACC = TP + TN /TP + TN + FP + FN



What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?


Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened when it hasn’t, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is happening when in fact something is.

A clever way to think about this is to think of Type I error as telling a man he is pregnant, while Type II error means you tell a pregnant woman she isn’t carrying a baby.

We commit a Type 1 error if we reject the null hypothesis when it is true. This is a false positive, like a fire alarm that rings when there's no fire.
 
A Type 2 error happens if we fail to reject the null when it is not true. This is a false negative—like an alarm that fails to sound when there is a fire.
